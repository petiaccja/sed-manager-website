# Activating locking

So you've [set your owner's password](docs/usage/configuration/take_ownership.mdx). That means your data is protected and encrypted, right? **No!** The next step in the process to activate the locking feature of your drive.

When activating locking, SEDManager will ask you for your owner password, and, optionally, you can enter an admin password as well. You can also chose to just used the owner password as the admin password as well. (Later you can change the two password independently, even if they are initially the same.) The admin password will be used in the subsequent steps to configure everything related to locking and encryption.

Feel free to reuse your owner password as the admin password, it's not a security risk if you're the only one using the drive anyway. If there are multiple people with different permissions to the device, then configuring a separate password can be a good idea.

## What does activation do?

Activating locking merely enables the locking features of the device and configures a password for an admin authority that can manage the settings related to locking and data encryption. Activating locking alone does not protect your data.
