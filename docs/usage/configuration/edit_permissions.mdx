# Editing permissions

## Configurable permissions

SEDManager allows you to configure the following permissions:
- **Unshadow MBR**: When checked, the user can unshadow the MBR, revealing the (still encrypted) contents of the drive.
- **Read unlock a range**: The selected user can clear read protection on the particular locking range.
- **Write unlock a range**: Same, but for write protection.

## Configurable users

On the user select dropdown, you can spot a new user called *Users* that you haven't seen while setting up users. This is a user group that contains User1, User2, and the rest of the users. Giving permission to the *Users* group is the same as giving permission to *all* users.

The admins are missing from this page, because they have access to everything so there is nothing to configure. There exists a group for admins as well, but the *Admins* group is also missing from this page.

## How should I configure permissions?

### You're the only one using the drive

Just give *User1* -- that you previously configured on the users page -- permission to the global range and to unshadow the MBR.

### You're sharing the drive with others

Give each user access to their own locking range, and possibly to shared locking ranges. In most cases, you can allow all users to unshadow the MBR either by enabling it for each user separately or by enabling it for the *Users* group.
