# Editing permissions

## Permissions you can set

- **Unshadow MBR**: When checked, the user can [unshadow the MBR](/docs/theory/the_tcg_spec#mbr-shadowing), revealing the (still encrypted) contents of the drive.
- **Read unlock a range**: The selected user can disable read protection on the locking range, making its contents readable.
- **Write unlock a range**: Disable write protection, making the locking range writable.

## Users listed on the page

### *Users* authority

The *Users* authority is a group that includes all users. Giving permission to the *Users* authority means every *User* has that permission too.

### Admins

Admin always have all the permissions, so there is nothing you can configure on them. Consequently, they are not shown on the permissions page.

## How should I configure permissions?

- **You're the only one using the drive**: Give *User1* (that you've previously enabled) permission to unshadow the MBR and to read-write unlock the global range.
- **You're sharing the drive with others**: Give each user access to their own locking range and to any shared ranges you've set up. typically, you can allow all users to unshadow the MBR. You can do this by allowing unshadowing for the *Users* group.
