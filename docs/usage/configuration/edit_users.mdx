# Editing users

## Admins and users

In connection with locking, you will see two kinds of [authorities](/docs/theory/the_tcg_spec#authorities):
- Admins: They have full access to changing the configuration and can unlock all locking ranges.
- Users: They can be given permission to unlock one or more locking ranges.

The Admin1 authority cannot be disabled, while the rest of the Admins can be enabled or disabled as you like. Since SEDManager does not use any of the other Admin authorities, it's recommended that you keep them disabled. Users can also be enabled or disabled as you like. Don't enable Users unless you're actually using them.

## User parameters

You can configure the following parameters for each Admin or User:
- **Enabled**: When set to false, the user cannot be authenticated, even if the correct password is provided.
- **Name**: You can set an informational name (e.g. *John Doe*), a unique username (e.g. *john_doe*), or leave it blank. In the PBA environment, you can log in using either the name given here (*john_doe*) or the canonical name (*User1*).
- **Password**: Changes the password that the user authenticates with.

:::warning Don't lock yourself out

This page allows you to change the password of Admin1. Be aware that the Admin1 listed here is the same Admin1 you used to enter this configuration page, so you can easily lock yourself out if you carelessly change the password.

:::info Changing Users' passwords

Currently, this is the only page where you can change passwords. Support is planned for users to change their own password, but, for now, you have to open this page and ask them to enter their new password while looking away.

## How should I configure users?

- **You're the only one using the drive**: Enable User1, set a username (e.g. john_doe), and set a password. Reusing the owner's password has a very small effect on overall security, so it's fine to do so.
- **You're sharing the drive with others**: Enable one User for each person using the drive, set their usernames (e.g. alice_92, bob_76), and set a default password for them. Each user's password should be unique and different from both the Admin1 and the owner's password. If the owner also has a User, you can reuse the owner's password for that User.

## Name and password limitations

### Character encoding

SEDManager uses [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) to encode both names and passwords. The encoding supports essentially all characters and writing systems, and is invisible to you. It's important to note that some characters (e.g. Japanese or Chinese script) take more space when encoded, which matters for the length limit on names and passwords.

### Length limit

Devices support only up to 32 bytes for both names and passwords. For latin script, this means up to 32 characters, however, for other scripts whose characters are encoded as multiple bytes, the limit may be reduced down to 8 characters.

### Character set limitations

The self-encrypting drives are not required to support arbitrary characters, so while unexpected, it's possible that they only support latin script. In this case, you will get an error while trying to set user names or passwords.

### Locale

Currently, the PBA environment uses the en-US locale and keyboard layout when entering your password. This may lead to problems entering your password in the PBA environment even when there were no issues in the configuration UI.
