# Editing users

## Admins and users

Most TCG devices come with a set of admins and users. (Enterprise devices have neither, while KPIO devices have only admins.) By default, only Admin1 is enabled, and it also cannot be disabled. The rest of the admins and users can be enabled or disabled at will. While SEDManager lets you configure all admins, it never actually uses them aside from Admin1. Admins are used for configuring locking ranges, users, and permissions, whereas users are used for unlocking one or more locking ranges during everyday use.

## Setting user parameters

SEDManager lets you configure the following parameters:
- **Enabled**: When set to false, the user cannot be authenticated, even if the correct password is provided.
- **Name**: The name field can be purely informational (e.g. John Doe), but the PBA environment also makes it possible to use it for authentication, so you might want to set the names to unique usernames (e.g. john_doe). The names don't serve any other purpose, and you can always authenticate as *User1* instead of *john_doe*.
- **Password**: Changes the password that the user authenticates with.

:::info Changing Admin1's password

The user configuration panel allows you to change any user's password, including the password of Admin1. Be aware that the Admin1 listed here is the same Admin1 you used to enter this configuration page, so don't accidentally lock yourself out by carelessly changing the password.

## How should I configure users?

### You're the only one using the drive

Just enable User1, set a username (e.g. john_doe), and set a password. You can reuse the owner's password again, just like you can reuse it for the Admin1 password. It doesn't matter since you're the only one with access to the drive.

### You're sharing the drive with others

Enable one UserN for each person using the drive, set their usernames (e.g. alice_92, bob_the_douche, chaplin_c), and set a default password for them. Each user's password should be unique and different from both the Admin1 and the owner's password.

:::info Changing passwords

Currently, this is the only page where you can change passwords. Support is planned for users to change their own password, but, for now, you have to open this page and ask them to enter their new password while looking away.

## Format of passwords and names

### Non-english characters

It depends on the device whether it supports any character, or just the English alphabet plus numbers. In case the device does not support non-English characters, you should see an error message if you try to enter such a name or password. SEDManager supports all characters and alphabets.

### Name and password length

Names and passwords are limited to at most 32 characters. If you enter a longer one, you should get an error message. Non-English characters may account for up to 4 characters towards the 32-character limit.

### UTF-8 encoding

SEDManager uses UTF-8 to encode both names and passwords. This is only relevant if you use non-ASCII characters and if you use other tools alongside SEDManager. SEDManager will always display names that were set in SEDManager correctly, and the same goes for passwords.

### Keyboard layouts

The PBA environment uses the US English keyboard layout, so it's best if your passwords and usernames can be easily types with that.
