# Taking ownership

## Setting the owner's password

The [owner authority](../..//background/tcg_specs.mdx#authorities) comes with a factory-configured default password. Taking ownership of the device is a single step to change the owner's password to something only you know.

The owner has the authority to:
- Enable and disable the locking features
- Revert the device to factory defaults

While it's not possible to access encrypted data even if you have the owner's password, changing it ensures that people don't tamper with the device.

:::info PSID revert

Should you lose your owner's password, you can still revert the device using the *PSID password*, which you typically find printed onto the device's label or inside a booklet that came in the package.

:::warning Don't brick your device

If you lose both your owner's password and your PSID password, there is no way to revert your drive and set a new owner's password, though you can still access your data. If you also lose your encryption password, your device becomes unusable and you have to buy a new one.
